1.1 Project Overview 
The Sales Analysis Project aims to analyze sales data to identify trends, improve business decision
making, and optimize revenue generation. The project will focus on gathering, processing, and 
visualizing sales data to extract actionable insights. 
1.2 Objectives 
• Understand sales trends over time. 
• Identify high-performing products and customer segments. 
• Improve demand forecasting and inventory management. 
• Generate interactive dashboards for data visualization. 
1.3 Scope 
The project will include data collection from various sources, data preprocessing, exploratory data 
analysis, trend identification, and visualization. It will also involve generating automated reports and 
predictive insights for sales forecasting. 
1.4 Project Timeline 
To ensure the smooth execution of the project, we created a detailed timeline based on the 
phases of data analysis and presentation. The available duration is distributed as follows:

Phase 1: Data Collection (Week 1) 
• Gather store transaction data from multiple sources. 
• Ensure data completeness and integrity. 
• Identify key variables for analysis. 
 
Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Week 2 ) 
• Handle missing or inconsistent values. 
• Standardize data formats for uniformity. 
• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect patterns and anomalies. 
 
Phase 3: Data Analysis & Visualization (Weeks 3-4) 
• Apply statistical techniques to identify trends. 
• Generate charts and dashboards for insights. 
• Implement machine learning models (if applicable). 
 
Phase 4: Report Preparation & Documentation (Week 5) 
• Summarize findings in a detailed report. 
• Prepare case studies and comparisons. 
• Document methodology, challenges, and solutions. 
 
Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 6) 
• Verify accuracy and reliability of insights. 
• Conduct usability testing on the analytical dashboard. 
• Make improvements based on feedback. 
 
Phase 6: Final Presentation & Submission (Week 7) 
• Create a structured presentation. 
• Rehearse and refine the delivery. 
• Submit the final report and supporting materials.

1.5 Task Assignment& Roles 
Each team member has a defined role in the project.  
• Data Collection: Responsible for acquiring and validating data sources. 
• Data Cleaning & Processing: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency. 
• Analysis & Visualization: Applying statistical methods and creating dashboards. 
• Report Generation: Documenting insights and creating presentations. 
 
1.6 Risk Assessment & Mitigation 
• Data Quality Issues: Addressed by implementing validation techniques. 
• Time Constraints: Managed by setting milestones and review checkpoints. 
• Technical Challenges: Resolved through collaboration and research. 
 
1.7 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) 
We will measure our project’s success using key performance indicators such as data accuracy, and 
user adoption rate. These metrics will help ensure the efficiency and reliability of our analysis. 
 
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Research Background 
Store data analysis is widely used in retail to improve decision-making. Previous studies highlight 
the importance of sales forecasting, inventory management, and customer behavior analysis. Various 
methodologies such as machine learning and statistical analysis have been applied to similar projects. 
 
2.2 Feedback & Evaluation 
We will regularly consult with our lecturer to get feedback on our approach and methodology. This 
will help us refine our techniques and ensure our project meets academic and industry standards.

2.3 Suggested Improvements 
Based on evaluations, we will make necessary adjustments to improve our data processing 
techniques, visualizations, and overall analysis. Suggestions from peers and mentors will also be 
incorporated. 
3. Requirements Gathering 
3.1 Stakeholder Analysis 
The key stakeholders in our project include store managers, data analysts, and customers. Store 
managers need insights to optimize inventory, analysts require accurate data processing, and 
customers benefit from better product availability. 
 
3.2 User Stories & Use Cases 
To illustrate how users interact with our system, we created user stories. For example, a store 
manager wants to see which products sell the most during weekends, while an analyst wants to 
generate sales trend reports. 
 
3.3 Functional Requirements 
The system will include features such as: 
• Data import and export capabilities 
• Interactive dashboards for visualization 
• Automated trend detection and report generation 
 
3.4 Non-functional Requirements 
The system will be: 
• Efficient : Process large datasets quickly 
• Secure: Protect data from unauthorized access 
• User-friendly: Provide an intuitive interface 
• Reliable: Ensure minimal downtime and high availability
